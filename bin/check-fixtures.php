/**
 * Checks the test fixtures under tests/fixtures/ against the SHA-256 checksums
 * in tests/fixtures/manifest.json.
 *
 * Usage: php bin/check-fixtures.php [fixtures-directory]
 *
 * For each set of fixtures, the script lists every file under the paths the
 * manifest names, sorts the paths byte by byte, computes the SHA-256 of each
 * file, and computes the SHA-256 of the resulting lines: the value, two
 * spaces, and the path with "./" in front. That is the method that
 * tests/fixtures/README.md describes, and it gives the same value as the shell
 * commands there. A path may end in a pattern such as "*.nq", which matches
 * every file of that name in the directory. The script also reports any file in
 * a set's directory that the manifest's paths do not cover.
 *
 * It exits with 0 when every set matches and 1 when any does not.
